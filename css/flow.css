/* 
In CSS, float and clear are properties used to control the positioning of elements within a
web page. Here's a detailed explanation of each:

Float
The float property is used to place an element to the left or right within its container,
allowing text and inline elements to wrap around it. Common values for the float property are:

left: The element floats to the left of its container.
right: The element floats to the right of its container.
none: The element does not float. This is the default value.
inherit: The element inherits the float value from its parent. 
*/

.box {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  margin: 10px;
  text-align: center;
}
.left {
  float: left;
  background-color: lightblue;
}
.right {
  float: right;
  background-color: lightcoral;
}

/* 
Clear
The clear property is used to control the behavior of an element when it follows a floated element.
It specifies whether an element should be moved down to avoid floating elements on its left or
right side.

Common values for the clear property are:

left: The element will not allow floating elements on its left side.
right: The element will not allow floating elements on its right side.
both: The element will not allow floating elements on either side.
none: The element does not clear any floats. This is the default value.
inherit: The element inherits the clear value from its parent.

.clear {
  clear: both;
  background-color: lightgreen;
  width: 100%;
  height: 50px;
  margin: 10px 0;
