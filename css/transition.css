/* 
In CSS, transitions allow you to change property values smoothly (over a given duration). 
To create a transition, you typically specify the properties you want to animate, 
the duration of the animation, the timing function, and optionally a delay before the
animation starts.
*/

selector {
  transition: property duration timing-function delay;
}
/* we can use the 'all' value in the property to affect all properties */

/* Example */

/* Suppose you want to smoothly change the background color of a button when the user hovers over it: */
.my-button {
  background-color: #4f46e5;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: background-color 0.3s ease;
}

.my-button:hover {
  background-color: #372eb1;
}
/* 
Explanation
transition: background-color 0.3s ease;: This specifies that the background-color property
should transition over 0.3 seconds using the ease timing function.
.my-button:hover { background-color: #372eb1; }: When the user hovers over the button, 
the background color changes to #372eb1.
Transition Properties
property: The name of the CSS property you want to add a transition effect to 
(e.g., background-color, width, height, etc.). You can use all to apply transitions to all 
properties.
duration: The duration of the transition (e.g., 0.5s for half a second, 1s for one second).
timing-function: The speed curve of the transition effect (e.g., ease, linear, ease-in, ease-out, 
ease-in-out, cubic-bezier).
delay: The delay before the transition starts (e.g., 0s, 1s).
